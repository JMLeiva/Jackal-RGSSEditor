# JML - RGSSEditor
RGSS (1, 2, 3) Code Editor for RPGMakerXP, RPGMakerVX & RPGMakerVX Ace.

This editor is intended to replace the (limited) built int editor of the RPG Maker series. 
It's developed in ruby, and uses FXRuby for GUI, and FXGUI's Scintilla wrapper for the text editor.

## Main Features

- **Flexible window size:** set the size of the editor as big as your monitor allows you.
- **Multi page:** open many script file pages at time. No more pain going from one script to another.
- **Run from the editor:** run your project from inside the JML RGSS Editor
- **Search:** search inside a single script, or in all your project.
- **[TODO] Editable color themes:** set your favourite color combination for the text editor.
- **[TODO] Code completion:** smart code completion based on a realtime parse of your code
- **[TODO] Error checking:** find quickly any "static" error (Syntax, UndefinedMethod, etc)
